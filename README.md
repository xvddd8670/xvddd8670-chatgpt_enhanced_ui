The scripts work without using the API. Because of this, there may be some operational issues.
For example, bulk adding of chats doesn't work properly — only a limited number from the list is read.
Also, if you delete a chat that was added to a folder, you have to remove it manually from the folder, otherwise a blank item with an empty link will remain there.

If you can suggest a solution that doesn’t require using the API, please let me know.
