The scripts are intended for use with Tampermonkey, Violentmonkey, and other browser script extensions.

Work without using the API. Because of this, there may be some operational issues.
Bulk adding of chats doesn't work properly — only a limited number from the list is read.
Also, if you delete a chat that was added to a folder, you have to remove it manually from the folder, otherwise a item with an empty link will remain there.

If you can suggest a solution that doesn’t require using the API, please let me know.
